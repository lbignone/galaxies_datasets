How to report a bug
-------------------

Report bugs on the `Issue Tracker`_.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case,
and/or steps to reproduce the issue.

How to set up your development environment
------------------------------------------

You need Python 3.7.1+ and the following tools:

- Poetry_
- Nox_
- nox-poetry_

Install the package with development requirements:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry install

You can now run an interactive Python session,
or the command-line interface:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry run python
   $ poetry run galaxies_datasets

.. _Poetry: https://python-poetry.org/
.. _Nox: https://nox.thea.codes/
.. _nox-poetry: https://nox-poetry.readthedocs.io/

How to set up your development environment (detailed instructions)
------------------------------------------------------------------

`Fork and clone`_ this repository.

Install Poetry_ to manage dependencies and packaging.

Install Nox_ to manage automated testing and other operations.

Install nox-poetry_ to use Poetry_ inside Nox_ sessions.

Install pyenv_ to manage the multiple Python versions supported.

Once pyenv is installed you can install Python versions 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9

.. code:: console

   $ pyenv install 3.7.12
   $ pyenv install 3.8.12
   $ pyenv install 3.9.10

It is recommended that you create a :code:`.python-version` file in the root directory of
the project. This will help pyenv determine which Python version to use. The content
of the file should be:

.. code::

   3.9.10
   3.8.12
   3.7.12

Make sure that poetry is using the correct Python version

.. code:: console

   $ poetry env use 3.9

Install the package with development requirements:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry install

Activate the development virtual environment

.. code:: console

   $ poetry shell

.. _pyenv: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv

How to test the project
-----------------------

Run the full test suite:

.. code:: console

   $ nox

List the available Nox sessions:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --list-sessions

You can also run a specific Nox session.
For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=tests

Unit tests are located in the ``tests`` directory,
and are written using the pytest_ testing framework.

.. _pytest: https://pytest.readthedocs.io/


How to submit changes
---------------------

Open a `pull request`_ to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains 100% code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before commiting your change, you can install pre-commit as a Git hook by running the following command:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=pre-commit -- install

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.
