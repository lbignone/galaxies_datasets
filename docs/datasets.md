# Datasets

## eagle

**Description**:

This dataset contains mock galaxy images generated from the [EAGLE collection of
hydrodynamic cosmological simulations](http://icc.dur.ac.uk/Eagle/).

Images are 256x256x3 pngs in three orientation: edge-on, face-on and box, ie.
aligned with the xy projection of the simulation box.

Entries in the dataset are identified by their GalaxyID, matching the ones in the
EAGLE public database. The snapshot number is also included.

Datasets for each simulation can be access using the name `eagle/simulation` (e.g.
`eagle/RefL0100N1504`)

Available simulations are:

- RefL0100N1504
- RefL0025N0752
- RefL0025N0376
- RecalL0025N0752

## galaxy_zoo2

**Description**:

Dataset containing images from the "original" sample of subject images in
Galaxy Zoo 2 and morphological classification from Hart et al. (2016).
Images are obtained from [this repository](https://zenodo.org/record/3565489#.YSOxXffQ9hF) and
the morhological classification from "GZ2 - Table 1 - Normal-depth sample
with new debiasing method â€“ CSV" (from Hart et al. 2016), which is available at
[data.galaxyzoo.org](https://data.galaxyzoo.org/)

## galaxy_zoo3d

**Description**:

centres, foreground stars, galactic bars and spiral arms in all galaxies in the
target file for the MaNGA survey. Data comes from the "Galaxy Zoo: 3D" project (

Detailed Visual Morphology Measurements from Volunteers and Deep Learning
for 314000 Galaxies"

**Homepage**: [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4196266](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4196266)

**Manual download instructions**:
Download from this [Zenodo
repository](https://zenodo.org/record/4573248#.YSEdzPfQ_mg) the
following three csv files and place them in `manual_dir/galaxy_zoo_decals`

- gz_decals_volunteers_1_and_2.csv
- gz_decals_volunteers_5.csv
- gz_decals_auto_posteriors.csv

Also download all four gz_decals_dr5_png_part\*.zip files and extract
them in `manual_dir/galaxy_zoo_decals`. You should end up with with
four folders structured like this:

    gz_decals_dr5_png_part*.zip/J*/J*.png
